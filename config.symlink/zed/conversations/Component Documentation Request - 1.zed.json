This key allows you to customize the appearance of selected text in the editor.\n\nTo style the text selection in your Zed theme, you can use the following properties:\n\n1. `ui.selection.background`: Sets the background color of the selected text.\n2. `ui.selection.foreground`: Sets the text color of the selected text (optional, if not specified, the original text color is maintained).\n\nHere's an example of how you might use these in a Zed theme file:\n\n```toml\n[ui.selection]\nbackground = \"#4A4A4A\"\nforeground = \"#FFFFFF\"\n```\n\nThis would set the text selection background to a dark gray color and the selected text color to white.\n\nRemember that the exact syntax and available options may vary depending on the version of Zed you're using, so it's always a good idea to check the most recent documentation or theme examples provided by Zed.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1415}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":356},"start":59,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1416}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":357},"start":968,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1417}},"image_offsets":[]}],"summary":"Component Documentation Request","slash_command_output_sections":[]}
