Something like `MakePublic<T>` that would take a class and return a class with all fields public (just change the type, but not touch the actual implementation).\nYes, you can create a utility type in TypeScript to expose private and protected fields of a class at the type level, without changing the actual implementation. Here's how you can create a `MakePublic<T>` type:\n\n```typescript\ntype MakePublic<T> = {\n  [K in keyof T]: T[K]\n}\n```\n\nThis utility type uses a mapped type to create a new type where all properties of the original type `T` are made public.\n\nHere's an example of how to use it:\n\n```typescript\nclass Example {\n  private privateField: string;\n  protected protectedField: number;\n  public publicField: boolean;\n\n  constructor() {\n    this.privateField = \"private\";\n    this.protectedField = 123;\n    this.publicField = true;\n  }\n\n  private privateMethod() {\n    console.log(\"private method\");\n  }\n\n  protected protectedMethod() {\n    console.log(\"protected method\");\n  }\n\n  public publicMethod() {\n    console.log(\"public method\");\n  }\n}\n\n// Usage\ntype PublicExample = MakePublic<Example>;\n\n// Now you can access all fields and methods in the type system\nconst publicExample: PublicExample = new Example() as PublicExample;\n\n// TypeScript will allow these, even though they're not actually accessible at runtime\npublicExample.privateField;\npublicExample.protectedField;\npublicExample.publicField;\npublicExample.privateMethod();\npublicExample.protectedMethod();\npublicExample.publicMethod();\n```\n\nImportant notes:\n\n1. This only changes the type, not the actual JavaScript implementation. At runtime, private and protected members will still be inaccessible.\n\n2. The `as PublicExample` cast is necessary because TypeScript won't allow you to assign an `Example` instance directly to a `PublicExample` type.\n\n3. This approach exposes all members, including methods. If you only want to expose fields, you can modify the utility type:\n\n```typescript\ntype MakeFieldsPublic<T> = {\n  [K in keyof T]: T[K] extends Function ? never : T[K]\n}\n```\n\nThis version will only include non-function properties in the resulting type.\n\nRemember that this is purely a type-level operation. It doesn't affect the actual behavior of the class at runtime, and it doesn't provide any actual access to private or protected members. It's mainly useful for type manipulation and in scenarios where you need to work with the structure of a class in a more flexible way within the type system.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":759}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":67},"start":257,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":760}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":68},"start":2578,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":761}},"image_offsets":[]}],"summary":"Exposing private and protected fields in TypeScript types","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default"}]}
